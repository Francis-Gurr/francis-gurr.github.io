			% SUMMARY
			\section{Summary}
			%As a Software Engineer at Pendo, I developed the new Roadmap tool from scratch, acted as a team tech lead, acquired expertise in various technologies, and contributed to the office culture. I completed a Master's degree at Durham University, utilising machine learning to detect vehicle speed, and completed internships with Q-Free and the Durham University Maths Department.
			I have two years of experience as a software engineer, with a primary focus on front-end development, although my interest also extends to full-stack.
			
			I am passionate about continuous learning and enjoy working in challenging environments that facilitate personal and professional growth.

			Working on personal programming projects is not only a hobby for me, but also an opportunity to expand my skillset and experiment with new technologies.
			While I have some examples of my work on my website and GitHub, many of my projects are small experiments that I enjoy tinkering with on my home server.

			When I am not at the computer, you can find me rock climbing, mountain unicycling and occasionally juggling.

	% Final Year Project
	\xp{Masters Project - 1st Class (80\%)}{Durham University}{2020}
	\begin{itemise}
		\item Utilized machine learning to detect and provide real-time vehicle speed from roadside camera footage
		\item Developed Python software to calibrate the camera using road markings and used C++ to calculate vehicle speeds
		\item The results were published in a paper in the International Journal of Intelligent Transportation Systems Research \textsb{20}(2022) under the title "Camera-Based System for the Automatic Detection of Vehicle Axle Count and Speed Using Convolutional Neural Networks", \href{https://doi.org/10.1007/s13177-022-00325-1}{DOI: 10.1007/s13177-022-00325-1 \faExternalLink}
		\item The project was sponsored by Q-Free and aimed to add a unique product to the market with a non-intrusive alternative to current ITS and infomobility systems
